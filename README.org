* Shut The Box
This iOS app allows a user to play the game Shut The Box.  Shut The Box is a
game consisting of 9 wooden pegs standing up in a box.  Each round, the player
rolls 2 dice and has the option of putting down any pegs that sum up to the
roll's total.  If a player rolls a sum that cannot be constructed from any
available pegs, the game is over and the player's score is the sum of the
remaining pegs.  The lowest score wins.  If the player can put down all the
pegs, that player has *Shut The Box!*
